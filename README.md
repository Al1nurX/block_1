# Blockchain Application

This project is a collaborative effort to develop a command-line blockchain application in JavaScript. The application includes implementations for asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, and core blockchain features.

## Asymmetric Encryption Implementation

In this section, we manually implement asymmetric encryption without using pre-existing libraries. The generated public and private keys are utilized in the subsequent digital signature implementation.

## Digital Signature Implementation

We develop a digital signature mechanism using the encryption method from the Asymmetric Encryption Implementation section. The digital signature is then used in the blockchain application for transaction verification.

## Blockchain Application Development

This section covers the development of the blockchain application, including:

- User Interface
- Encryption and Digital Signature Integration
- Hashing
- Blockchain Core Features (Blocks, Transaction Management, Merkle Tree)
